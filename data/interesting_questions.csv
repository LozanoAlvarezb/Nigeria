535,Screenshot of a DW Africa post on the resignation of Mr. Amidu is fake.,"Claim: social media users claim a screenshot of a DW Africa post on the resignation of Mr. Amidu is fake.

From the evidence provided, it is true that DW Africa authored the said post. Dubawa could not also find any evidence of a disclaimer by DW Africa on the said post. Therefore, the claim that the said Facebook post is fake, is false.

Full text

The resignation of Special Prosecutor Martin Amidu has been greeted with mixed reactions from Ghanaians.

While some commend Mr. Amidu for his decision to quit, others think he should have stayed on and fought to the end.

The Special Prosecutor resigned on Monday, November 16, citing interference from the government.

The issue has attracted the attention of a number of international media outlets.

A screenshot of a Facebook post said to be made by DW Africa is being widely shared on various social media platforms.

The post reads:

Ghana’s Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor Martin Amidu has resigned. The former attorney general accuses President Nana Akufo-Addo of political interference. Amidu said he had become convinced “that I was not intended to exercise any independence” in the job. The prosecutor said he quit after the president tried to get him to “shelve” a report on a plan to sell the country’s future gold royalties to an offshore firm that involved the finance minister, who is also the president’s cousin. Should Ghana be worried about this development?

However, some social media users, including Fiifi Asempa Baidoo, Enoch Kofi Nyarkoh, Kwesi Reynolds, among others, claim the screenshot being circulated is fake.

Another screenshot of the post, with “fake page” embossed on it, is also being widely shared on social media.

A news item on a news portal (gh.opera.news) also claims DW Africa denied making the said post.

Verification

Ghana’s DW Africa correspondent, Isaac Kaledzi, filed a report on Mr. Amidu’s resignation, the audio of which is on the DW Africa website.

“He said the threats he got recently for releasing a report on plans to monetise Ghana’s future gold royalties to an offshore firm involving the Finance Minister, the president’s cousin, forced him out. The president allegedly asked Mr. Amidu to shelve the report but he declined,” Kaledzi’s report partly reads.

Aside from the audio report, the said post about the Special Prosecutor’s resignation can be found on the official and verified Facebook page of DW Africa and was posted on Tuesday, November 17, 2020.

“The prosecutor said he quit after the president tried to get him to “shelve” a report on a plan to sell the country’s future gold royalties to an offshore firm that involved the finance minister, who is also the president’s cousin,” DW Africa Facebook post read in part.

56,Multiple social media users claimed that a Nigeria Customs Service officer in a recent viral video is one of the repentant bandits “recruited” into the security forces in the country.,"Claim: Multiple social media users claimed that a Nigeria Customs Service officer in a recent viral video is one of the repentant bandits “recruited” into the security forces in the country.

The claim that repentant bandits are being recruited into the Nigerian Army and other security forces is spurious and misleading. The people in the two photos are entirely different.

Full Text

Nwaiwu Chiukwuebuka, a Facebook user, in a post on Saturday, October 16, had shared pictures of a Nigeria Customs Service officer and that of a supposedly repentant bandit.

According to him, the officer is one of the repentant bandits recruited to a significant security force in the country.

He also raised an alarm that members of Boko Haram are “being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies.”

Chiukwuebuka, whose Facebook bio reads “Protest writer and a patriotic unapologetic Biafran,” wrote:

“From Bandit to Nigeria custom Officer, same way Boko Haram is being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies.”

The post, spurious as it appears, was widely shared, with 344 reshares and 24 reactions amassed as of Tuesday, October 19.

Using the Crowdtangle web extension, a further check showed that another Facebook user with over 22,000 followers, Chinasa, Nworu, shared the picture.

Nworu, whose Facebook profile showed that he works at “Radio Biafra,” shared the post on October 16, and it amassed 2,100 shares, 126 comments and 294 reactions.

In the same vein on Twitter, a user with username @hashtag2weet with over 6,000 followers also shared the picture on Sunday, October 17. Findings by Dubawa also revealed that many WhatsApp users have re-shared the photo.

Banditry in Nigeria

Banditry, over recent times, has presented itself in forms of organised crimes including kidnapping, cattle rustling, mass abduction, arson, and armed robbery.

The security record in Nigeria showed that it began as a farmer-herder crisis in some states in northeast Nigeria like Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna, where it was first treated as a local affair.

Triggered by poverty and a break of leadership trust, banditry in Nigeria has festered into what appears like full-blown terrorism, with its activities climaxed by the recent shooting of a military fighter jet.

According to ACAPS, a non-profit, non-governmental project providing international, independent humanitarian analysis, between March 2020 and June 2021, over 1,400 students and staff have been kidnapped in several school abductions reported in northwest Nigeria.

These abductions took place in Kankara and Mahuta (Katsina state), Kagara and Tegina (Niger state), Jangebe and Maradun (Zamfara state), Mando, Afaka, and Kasarami (Kaduna state), and Birnin Yauri (Kebbi state).

State and federal governments have been taking some bold steps to eradicate banditry, including a special package for repentant bandits.

Like Operation Safe Corridor (OSC), Nigeria’s de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme for repentant Boko Haram members and bandits are promised a huge reward if they surrender their arms.

In February 2021, Auwalu Daudawa, a bandit leader who masterminded the kidnapping of schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina, surrendered over 22 weapons, including sophisticated AK-47 rifles.

Daudawa dropped his arms for the operative from the Zamfara police command alongside other bandits. However, he later returned to the forest to continue banditry, having been allegedly dissatisfied by the promise made to him by the government.

He was tragically killed during a gun duel with a rival gang at Dumburum forest located between Zurmi local government in Zamfara and Batsari local government in Katsina.

Before that, in January 2021, seven notorious bandits said they had repented and surrendered their weapons to the Zamfara state government. They offered 14 weapons including AK 47 rifles.

In April 2021, the Katsina police command said four bandits “voluntarily surrendered” their weapons including AK-47 rifles.

The conspiracy theory

Although the suspicious surrender of bandits has been described as a leap forward in the battle against banditry, many people believe that these blood-craving criminals including Boko haram terrorists are being given a soft landing despite their documented numerous atrocities.

The government officials’ colourful media parade of repentant bandits, coupled with the privileges they enjoy after dropping their weapons have since created a conspiracy theory that often lead to a whirlpool of debates on whether these criminals are being recruited into the major security forces in the country.

On Thursday, September 2, the Nigerian Army announced that almost 6,000 ex-terrorists had surrendered to the government.

But before the announcement, specifically in 2019, General Abdulmalik Biu, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 7 Division, urged terrorists to lay down their arms.

Biu said a repentant terrorist “stands to be a president of this country; he stands to aspire to any position in this country.”

This statement created a fuss and fuelled the conspiracy theory about repentant terrorists being recruited into the Nigerian Army.

In several defences in the past, the military force had debunked the recruitment claim and described it as false and misleading, “laced with mediocrity emanating from a poorly researched and uninformed position.”

Verification

Claim 1: Are Boko Haram and bandits being recruited into the Nigerian Army?

Although there are unintelligible claims that repentant bandits and Boko Haram terrorists are getting recruited into the security forces in the country, findings by Dubawa showed that they are just products of febrile imaginations of some people and mere conspiracy theories. There is no record to back it up!

In December 2019, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) dismissed the alleged recruitment of deredicalised Boko Haram ex-fighters into the Nigerian military.

Onyema Nwachukwu, the acting director of defence information emphasized in a statement that “contrary to claims, no Boko Haram ex-fighter has been recruited into the Nigerian military and no such plan is in the offing.

“The de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme is a Federal Government programme conducted under the auspices of Operation Safe Corridor as a non-kinetic operation,” he added.

Similarly in August 2021, the Nigerian Army also denied that it was recruiting ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits into the force.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the NA does not have any repentant terrorists joining its ranks and does not have any plan for that. There are teaming able-bodied Nigerians that are willing to join the NA and genuinely help in the fight against terrorism and other violent crimes,” Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, director, Army public relations, said.

Meanwhile, there are records that some repentant ex-terrorists are being reintegrated back into the society.

In May 2021, Nigerian Military announced that 603 repentant Boko Haram terrorists who have been rehabilitated would be reintegrated into the society in June.

Claim 2: Is the Nigerian Customs Service officer in a recent viral video a repentant bandit?

The Facebook user claimed NCS officer in the picture is a former bandit. Credit: Facebook

Verifying this claim, Dubawa ran a Yandex reverse image separately for the two collaged photos.

The first Yandex search showed Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state ‘posing’ with some bandits who surrendered their arms.

The second picture, a screenshot, was taken from a recent viral video of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) officer hilariously saluting his superior.

The original video is found on The Punch newspaper’s Instagram page, and Nollywood actor Victor Osuagwu’s IG handle.

A further search by Dubawa in respect to the first image showed that between 2019 and 2020, Governor Masari of Katsina, in a bid to lure errant youths out of banditry, met with some leaders of banditry who came to surrender their weapons.

In a report contained in Leadership newspaper, the Katsina governor was reported to have “presided over the state’s security council meeting with repentant bandits and others specifically dedicated to the contentious issues of banditry and kidnapping.”

In November 2020, Masari was reported to have received two repentant bandit leaders named Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji at the Government House in Katsina.

Are the two the same person?

Dubawa used an InVID’s Keyframe tool to analyse the video where the second image was taken. The result broke the footage into six frames, showing each image clearly.

Keyframe result on the video of the Customs officers.

The fourth frame from the result above, which looks like the one being shared in the claim, was subjected to Magnifier image analysis. Again, results showed no facial resemblance (nose, mouth and eye) between the “repentant” bandit and Customs operative mischievously shared as the same person.

Result of the Magnifier image analysis showed there is no resemblance.

Conclusion

The two pictures being shared are different and the claim surrounding them is false and highly misleading. Besides, no record showed that ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits are being recruited into the Nigerian Army.

489,Not wearing a mask in public places is a criminal offence,"Not wearing a mask in public places is a criminal offence – viral social media messages

The viral WhatsApp message is legislation issued on 6 April 2020 in Kenya for offenders who contravene the rule to properly wear masks in public places. Neither the government of Ghana nor any mainstream media in Ghana have so far communicated such information.

Full text

Subsequent to the lifting of the partial lockdown by the president of Ghana, Akufo-Addo, the government announced enhanced measures to control the spread of the Coronavirus in Ghanaian communities. One of such measures includes the wearing of nose masks by citizens in public places. This measure has further been enforced with a compulsory ‘No Mask, No Entry’ policy in public places by the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Ishmael Ashitey, in a press statement and by authorities in other parts of the country.

A viral message circulating on WhatsApp and other platforms in the country takes this further. It states that failure to wear a mask in public places is a criminal offence liable to a fine of 20,000 or 6-month imprisonment or both. The full message reads:

“It has finally been gazetted. Failure to wear a mask while in a Public place is actually a criminal offence. Section 6(1)(b) as read with section 11 of the Regulations. If found guilty you can be liable to a fine of 20,000/= or imprisonment for 6 months or both. Failure to wear a mask in a public or private transport and public transport operators Section 5(4) must wear mask. So don’t say you were not warned. Share widely with friends so that they should not leave the house without a mask. Public place means stepping outside your house. So, take precautions.”

Verification

Dubawa found that the same post has been shared on Facebook with comments indicating that the message originates from Kenya.

Further checks show the legislation was enacted in Kenya and not Ghana as the messages sought to suggest.

Google checks revealed that Kenyan media outlets here, here, and here published articles on the penalty of not wearing face masks between 9 and 15 April 2020.

Their publications indicated that the Kenyan government had issued a gazette stating that citizens were required to wear a proper nose mask that covers their mouth and nose. Anyone who contravened the rules was considered to have committed an offence liable to a fine not exceeding 20,000 shillings, imprisonment not exceeding 6-months or both.

Dubawa further found a copy of the Kenya Gazette Supplement No 41, a special issue on 6 April 2020, which according to some Kenyan media here, here was signed by the Health Cabinet Secretary, Mutahi Kagwe.

The photo below shows the section of the Kenya Gazette which states: the rule to wear a proper nose mask to cover both nose and mouth (4), an act of offence if it is contravened (5) and the penalty of a fine not exceeding 20, 000 shilling, imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or both if the offence is committed (11)

Screenshot of the legislation found online

Dubawa also noted that the viral WhatsApp message purported to be a new legislation in Ghana states the fine of 20, 000 and does not include the currency of Ghana (cedis) to it.

Meanwhile, the government of Ghana has not issued any official statement to communicate this purported new legislation on the penalty of not wearing masks in public places. Neither has any mainstream Ghanaian media published on such information.

Conclusion

The viral message circulating on Ghanaian WhatsApp outlets threatening to fine and or imprison offenders who fail to wear masks in public places is misleading. The message is new legislation on a Public Health Act against Coronavirus in Kenya, issued on 6 April 2020. Neither the government of Ghana nor Ghanaian mainstream media have conveyed any such information to citizens. Nonetheless, though the failure to wear masks may not be a criminal offence in Ghana, Ghana still has a compulsory ‘No Mask, No Entry’ directive for entering public places, to help control the spread of the virus in the county.",https://ghana.dubawa.org/is-the-failure-to-wear-a-mask-in-public-places-a-criminal-offence-in-ghana,Is not wearing a mask in public places considered a criminal offense in Ghana?
878,Chain message warns against accepting immunisation from coronavirus; says they are rather implanting COVID-19 through the said vaccine.,"Chain message warns against accepting immunisation from coronavirus; says they are rather implanting COVID-19 through the said vaccine.

The whole plot screams foul play! First, no news platform has published anything close, besides this, WHO has said there’s no vaccine yet for the virus. Also, a reverse image search proved that the claim-author manipulated one of the many images shared by health workers to encourage people to stay home during this trying time.

Full Text

A viral image on WhatsApp warns against accepting immunisation from coronavirus because they are implanting it through the vaccine. Although this message seems unclear, we believe the writer was trying to say that readers should refuse to be immunised because vaccines are being used to infect people with the virus.

The image shows a picture of a white doctor holding a white paper with a display text, which reads: “To all Africans, don’t accept to be immunised from coronavirus cause they’re implanting it through the vaccine.”

Verification

Once you see the word vaccine, it triggers curiosity causing one to wonder if there is now a cure for the disease; sadly, the answer remains the same -NO- we checked. The World Health Organization’s pronouncement on COVID-19 cure still stands; there’s no vaccine or any specific antiviral medicine that cures or prevents the disease. However, if infected, symptoms can be relieved. It is also worthy to note that some vaccines and treatments are under investigation.

In addition, we found no directive from the Nigerian government that permits immunization. Even if there is any, it would have been publicised by the media, considering that a vaccine for COVID-19 is a global expectation. Therefore if you get a hint or come across anyone immunizing for coronavirus you should blow the whistle.

Actual Premise

Dubawa checks revealed the original image from which the author made the WhatsApp manipulation.

More so, in furtherance to disproving this claim, we found other results from March 18:

Further search reveals more pictures of health workers displaying the same message on their placards.

697,"Articles published by some News site claimed that the excessive consumption of cold water has dire health consequences on the average person. It supposedly affects the veins, damages the heart and leads to a heart attack. ","Can cold water give you a heart attack or cancer?

This question was sparked by the recent News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) articles that were published on a number of news sites. Premium Times, Pulse Nigeria, Vanguard and Pharmanewsonline are just a few, albeit we counted seven. The articles claimed that the excessive consumption of cold water has dire health consequences on the average person. It supposedly affects the veins, damages the heart and leads to a heart attack. These articles, which were the product of an interview with a paediatrician in Warri stated: “excessive cold water consumption can cause the closure of four veins, and in the process lead to heart attack”.

It doesn’t stop there. He further asserts that excessive cold water consumption may also lead to cancer as a result of fats sticking to the liver.

As most gravitate towards that cup of cold water since we live in the tropics, this is unnerving news. But is it true?

Verification

Health authorities have long-established the ideals of how much water we should consume in a day. The 8 glasses (2 litres of water) a day mantra is an all too familiar one. But what do we know of the temperature of the water we consume – should we be drinking cold or warm water and is there a disadvantage to choosing one over the other?

Cold water in the body

Cold water in the body cannot be completely harmful; after all, cold drinks have been, and are still used in treating fevers.

It is first important that we understand the absorption of water in the body, more specifically the stomach through the means of a physiological explanation. The temperature in the stomach (which is also known as the core body temperature) is 37°C (98.6°F). A glass of cold water is about 4°C, (close to the temperature of ice). Room temperature or thermoneutral water is 22°C and warm water, anything above 30°C. Your water temperature preference does alter this very core body temperature, but, and this is the key point – only for a duration. This is because the processes in the stomach are such that a cold drink does not remain cold in the body, but is acclimated to the stomachs environment with metabolic heat (this also goes for the food you eat).

After ingestion, it takes exactly 5 minutes for water to be absorbed from the stomach, and subsequently the bloodstream. Within this 5 minute window, cold water is heated to maintain a stable core temperature, before making its way to the bloodstream. After this point, experts say, that the water is unaffected by temperature. Essentially the temperature of the water one ingests is inconsequential due to innate gastric adaptive responses.

William Gilman Thompson, in his book, best explains it when he said: “one may begin a dinner with iced raw oysters, then take hot soup, and later conclude the meal with ice cream, followed by hot coffee…and yet throughout, the temperature of the stomach contents does not vary so much as half a degree.”

Claim founded on quick sand…

Given the background, we can say that the warnings in these articles hold no ground. If science tells us that cold water is always adjusted to the core temperature in the stomach of 37°C, then all the warnings of damage to various organs caused by ingested cold water are inconceivable. Nevertheless, we examine each claim.

Heart attack

A heart attack is a life-threatening disease that results from a blocked coronary artery or arteries. Four veins can close leading to a heart attack, the articles claimed. To which no scientific evidence was provided as proof of such a link. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the cause of a heart attack is the accumulation of fat and cholesterol (plaque) from years of exposure to modifiable risk factors. These modifiable risk factors are smoking, obesity, an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Other causes of a heart attack could also include coronary artery spasm- a tightening of the muscles in the artery.

If this claim were even possible, a process known as vasoconstriction where the blood vessels become narrow might be the most intelligible explanation; yet, this is stretching the facts. This process, which is cold-induced, can indeed lead to a heart attack in peculiar circumstances. However, research has shown that this (constricted blood vessels) occurs when a person is immersed in a pool of cold water or is exposed to an extremely cold environment. And, not when they ingest the water. Hence, this claim does not hold here.

Cancer

This second part of the claim is based on a popular myth which claims that cold water results in the accumulation of fats which stick to the liver, causing cancer. What specific types of cancers though? We are not told as there is a multitude of cancers that vary depending on the part of the body affected.

It has been over a decade that this myth of an association between cold water and cancer has been in existence. It first surfaced in 2006. VeryWellHealth, Snopes, Hoax slayer, Says and Today have all debunked it in their various publications. Many of these articles make the point that the National Cancer Institute, a reputable source for all things cancer related, made no mention of such a correlation. Other health authorities could not find the link either; with the consensus being that it holds no factual basis.

Additionally, an analogy often used, suggests a correlation between cold water and oils with respect to the liver. It insinuated that drinking cold water with a meal containing fats/oils, solidifies the food the way cold water solidifies oils in your kitchen drains. The resultant effect was, causing them to stick to the liver on getting there.

This is not the case in the human body. Chylomicrons are the result of the breakdown of fats and oils. The new substance is then transported into the liver. They do not remain in their “eaten form”, and neither does the water drunk. Hence, this is certainly improbable.

Indigestion

A third part to the claims made in the article states that “cold water makes the blood vessels to shrink thereby causing indigestion”. Firstly, no studies support this assertion. Yes, there are irrefutable benefits of warm water in aiding digestion. Still, this does not necessarily translate to indigestion from cold water. Common causes of indigestion include eating too much, drinking too much, food intolerance, and/or taking some medicines on an empty stomach.

The only correlation we can draw is the thermal energy expenditure hypothesis. This theorizes that cold water slows down digestion as the stomach expends more energy ‘heating up’ cold water so that it is suitable for absorption. To this, we refer back to evidence of a clear-cut 5-minute duration in which ALL contents in the stomach adjust to the core body temperature. A study stated in clear terms that this 5 minutes is the same for all persons. It only varies from person to person on the volume that leaves the stomach.

Moreover, the claim mixes up two distinct systems in the body (circulatory system and the digestive system). Another false assumption made is that water drunk moves straight into circulation. Although, blood vessels constrict in reaction to cold (vasoconstriction). However, this is not the case here. Water does not move directly into the blood vessels in its ingested state. It first undergoes absorption by the small intestine.

Conclusion

There is no evidence to support any of the claims made in the articles. Health authorities have also said nothing of the sort. Instead, what we found is that the claims were underpinned by myths. You can have your drink of cold water!

Also, it is worth noting that while the phrase “excessive consumption” was used, it remained vague. It did not specify what that meant, like “how many glasses”? This further questions the veracity of the claims. However, we recognise that excessive consumption of anything is ill-advised. Nevertheless, it is far-fetched to suggest a correlation to a heart attack and cancer.",https://dubawa.org/excess-cold-water-cancer,Is there any scientific evidence to support the claim that excessive consumption of cold water can cause heart attacks or cancer?
484,A claim that DSS has no jurisdiction to make arrests.,"CLAIM: “DSS… They are not to arrest,” says Afe Babalola (SAN).

FALSE: Granted, the State Security Service (SSS) unconstitutionally refers to itself as the Department of State Services (DSS). However, there is no provision in the constitution or the National Security Agency Act that categorically states the inability of the SSS to make arrests.

FULL TEXT:

Afe Babalola SAN, renowned legal luminary had a lot to say concerning the Department of State Services’ (DSS) sting operation in 2016. During the Channels TV News night, he commented on the raid conducted on judges’ homes by the DSS.

“The DSS duty in law is merely to gather information and give it to the President and all that. They are not to arrest.” Afe Babalola SAN

The 2016 raid on Judges by DSS was neither the first nor the last incidence pertaining to an alleged unlawful arrest. As far back as 2014, Asari Dokubo, the Niger Delta Militant head was arrested for making inciting comments. Other cases include the arrest and re-arrest of Jones Abiri in 2016 and March 2019; with the most recent being the arrest of Omoyele Sowore on accounts of treason. The latter was featured in a Dubawa fact-check analysis, with a number of people calling to question the legality of the arrest by DSS.

VERIFICATION

At the time of conducting this fact-check, we are yet to touch base with Afe Babalola SAN to authentify his claims. Although, research revealed no legal precedence in case law to corroborate this claim. This fact-check will however be updated if and when new information arises.

Nonetheless we referred to the National Security Agencies Act, Decree 19 of June 5, 1986, for verification. The Act establishes the State Security Service and two other intelligence agencies for the Nigerian State after the dissolution of the Nigeria Security Organisation but did not mention anything about Department of State Service. This confirms what the fact-check done by Premium Times revealed. The name Department of State Services (DSS) has been unconstitutionally substituted to mean State Security Service (SSS). The check confirmed that the name change started when Marilyn Ogar was the spokesperson of the Intelligence Agency from 2009 to 2015.

Subject to varied interpretations

Nonetheless, there is no mention of the SSS’s ability or inability to make arrests. According to the Act, these are their responsibilities:

The State Security Service shall be charged with responsibility for –

(a) the prevention and detection within Nigeria of any crime against the internal security of Nigeria;

(b) the protection and preservation of all non-military classified matters concerning the internal security of Nigeria; and

(c) such other responsibilities affecting internal security within Nigeria as the National Assembly or the President, as the case may be, may deem necessary.

Examining subsection 3a, the prevention and detection of crimes against the internal security is subjective to various interpretations in the rule of law. It could very well grant them legal backing to do whatever in their jurisdiction to uphold their constitutional responsibility. Consequently, it is false to categorically assert their legal insufficiency to make arrests.

Note, we are not saying they have the right to make arrests, as that is not categorically stated either.

CONCLUSION:

The claim is FALSE. Granted, the State Security Service (SSS) unconstitutionally refers to itself as the Department of State Services (DSS). However, there is no provision in the constitution or the National Security Agency Act that categorically states the insufficiency or sufficiency of the SSS to make arrests.",https://dubawa.org/is-dss-authorized-to-make-arrests,Does the National Security Agencies Act explicitly state that the State Security Service (SSS) is unable to make arrests?

Credible sources from the presidency clarify that Abba Kyari who tested positive for COVID-19 is in Lagos for treatment. As regarding the President, no credible reports suggest he is infected with the novel coronavirus; not to mention absconding…

Full Text

Since the onset of COVID-19 in December 2019, over 199 countries have instances with over 465,915 confirmed cases; not to mention, the death toll is over 21,000. It is indeed, a dire picture.

Bringing it home, Nigeria currently has confirmed 65 active cases; 3 discharged and 1 death. In essence, Nigeria now records at least 5 cases of COVID-19 on an average every day.

On Tuesday, it was widely reported that the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari was tested positive to Coronavirus after his visit to Germany on March 7 and returned about a week later. Indeed, the minister of health, Osagie Ehanire confirmed that a top aide to the president is infected with the virus.

Further, on Thursday, a voice message went viral on WhatsApp and Twitter claiming Mr Buhari and Mr Kyari have been flown out of the country to the United Kingdom for treatment.

Verification

Firstly, Dubawa checks traced this message to a sound cloud recording by a certain Jackson Ude; after which news blog “TheInfong” amplified this message with a report and subsequently, social media interactions.

Buhari and Abba Kyari allegedly flown out of Nigeria for Coronavirus treatment : LEAKED AUDIO https://t.co/KSUp7HodyG — Theinfong.com (@TheInfoNG) March 26, 2020

To verify this claim, Dubawa reached out to Garba Shehu, the spokesperson to the president who neither denied nor confirmed the travel claim.

We, however, go clarification from anonymous sources in the presidency. According to them, while Abba Kyari is not in Abuja, he did not travel abroad. Instead, he was transferred to a Lagos treatment facility.

Additionally, Bashir Ahmed, the special assistant to the president on new media, debunked the travel claim.

FAKE NEWS ALERT: The voice note that President @MBuhari and Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari have been secretly flown out of the country is totally UNTRUE. It was intentionally recorded to cause chaos and fear. This fake news was originated and being circulated by one @jacksonpbn. — Bashir Ahmad (@BashirAhmaad) March 26, 2020

Conclusion

Finally, considering facts from RELIABLE sources, it is FALSE to say that Mr Kyarri was flown out of the country. Further, given the fact that the presidency placed travel restrictions, it would be baseless conjecture to suggest that they “sneaked away”. It is also worth noting the recent proliferation of falsehoods regarding the state of public officeholders; the reason for this, we do not know. Perhaps this is happening because of the one confirmed positive?

Notwithstanding, we reiterate you always take caution in what information you are reading or believing.

Ahead of the Edo State governorship elections which is currently underway, Channels Television organised a debate between the candidates of the two major political parties in the gubernatorial race – The All Progressive Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The debate is a platform for the two contestants to defend their motives for competing for the governor’s office and provide answers to important and relevant questions to the people of Edo.

While answering questions during the Debate, the incumbent Governor of Edo State who is also contesting in the elections, Godwin Obaseki, said: “With a debt burden of 120 billion Naira, we have been able to service and still ensure that we undertake economic projects.”

Verification

To verify this, Dubawa identified when Obaseki was sworn in as Governor of Edo state, then consulted the Debt Management Office’s (DMO) website to know where the state’s debt stood before his administration.

After conducting a keyword search, Dubawa found that Obaseki was sworn-in November, 12th 2016. After that, we searched for the earliest debt record to the inauguration in the Debt Management Office’s archives. There, we found data from less than two months after his assumption of office – December 31st. According to DMO, Edo state’s domestic debts stood at N45.1bn while its external debt amounted to $183.64m.

Dubawa converted the External debt figure ($183,641,998.74) which was in Dollars to Naira. This was done using the dollar rate at the time (NOTE: As contained on the Central Bank of Nigeria’s website, the Inter bank rate for Dollar as at December 2016 was 305.22) before summing it with the Domestic figure (45,091,949,113.97) to give the total debts acquired by Edo in 2016. The sum of the two figures equals N101bn (N101,143,159,969.3928) which is less than the 120 Billion Naira claimed by the governor.

Further, we converted the external debt with the current data rate (N381 – CBN price of a dollar as of August 2020) and summed it up with the domestic figure, still, we did not get N120bn but N115bn.

Conclusion

The claim that Obaseki met 120 Billion Naira Debt is False as Data from the Debt Management Office contradicts the figure presented by the Governor of Edo state.",https://dubawa.org/obaseki-exaggerates-edos-2016-total-debt-figure,What was the actual amount of debt that Godwin Obaseki inherited when he became Governor of Edo state?

On February 13, 2022, a twitter user @Ahmed_Jimeta1 claimed that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had clinched all the chairmanship and councilorship seats at the just-concluded 2022 Federal Capital Territory (FCT) elections.

Mr Jimeta’s post was widely shared, generating 165 Retweets, 25 Quote Tweets and 615 Likes.

The elections were conducted on February 12, 2022 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) into the six FCT area councils: Abaji, Abuja Municipal (AMAC), Bwari, Gwagwalada, Kuje and Kwali, and for 62 council seats in wards across the FCT.

A total of 14 political parties participated in the election., but two of them – All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), dominated the polls.

Verification

Reports of the official results released by the electoral umpire, INEC, indicates a contrary position to the claims of the twitter user.

INEC figures show that the PDP won the chairmanship seat in three area councils (Kuje, Bwari and Abuja Municipal), while the All Progressives Congress (APC) clinched Gwagwalada, Kwali and Abaji.

In Kuje, the PDP’s Suleiman Sabo polled 13,301 votes to defeat Sarki Hamidu of the All Progressive Congress (APC), who secured 7,694 votes.

The PDP’s candidate, John Gabaya was re-elected for a second term in Bwari after scoring 13,045 votes ahead of the APC’s Audi Shekwolo who had 7,697 votes.

Christopher Zakka of the PDP was declared the winner of the chairmanship seat in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), having polled almost 20,000 votes to beat his closest rival, Murtala Karshi of the APC.

After the elections in Gwagwalada, Abubakar Jubrin of the APC was declared winner by INEC after scoring 11,125 votes against the 9,579 votes obtained by the PDP’s Kassim Mohammed.

In Abaji, the APC scored 7,280 votes to defeat Yahaya Garba of the PDP, who polled 4,063 votes. INEC declared APC winner, but failed to announce any particular candidate due to an ongoing legal tussle between two of the party’s candidates, Muhammad Loko and Umar Abdullahi.

Elections in Kwali Area Council ended with the declaration of APC candidate, Danladi Chiya, as winner and chairman-elect of the council. Mr Chiya obtained 7,646 votes against the 7,345 votes of his closest rival, Haruna Pai of the PDP.

The PDP did not also clinch all the council seats in the election, as official results have shown. While the PDP clinched all the councillor seats in Kuje, in Gwagwalada, the party picked six council seats against the four won by the APC. In Abuja Municipal (AMAC), the PDP won 10 seats, while the APC won just two.

Conclusion

Contrary to the claim by Mr Jimeta in his twitter post that the PDP won all seats for chairman and councillor in the 2022 FCT elections, official results released by INEC showed that the PDP and APC shared the seats. For the chairmanship seats, the PDP won in three area councils, with the APC clinching the remaining three councils, just as candidates of both parties won councillor seats across the six area councils.",https://dubawa.org/pdp-did-not-win-all-council-seats-at-fct-elections-as-claimed-by-this-twitter-user,Did the PDP win all the chairmanship and councillor seats at the 2022 FCT polls?
